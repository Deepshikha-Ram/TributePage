        <h2> 
            Early Life 
        </h2>
        <p>
            Einstein was born in Ulm Wurttemberg, Germany on 14 March 1879. His Family was Jewish,
            but was not very religious. However, later in life Einstein became very interested  in
            his Judaism.  Einstein did not begin speaking until he was 2 years old. According to 
            his younger sister, Maja, "He had such difficulty with language that those around him 
            feared he would never learn".[11] When Einstein was around 4 years old, his father 
            gave him a magnetic compass. He tried hard to understand how the needle could seem to 
            move itself so that it always pointed north. The needle was in a closed case, so clearly 
            nothing like wind could be pushing the needle around, and yet it moved. So in this way 
            Einstein became interested in studying science and mathematics. His compass gave him 
            ideas to explore the world of science.  
                            When he became older, he went to school in Switzerland. After he
            graduated, he got a job in the patent office there. While he was working there, he wrote 
            the papers that first made him famous as a great scientist.
                    Einstein married with a 20-year-old Serbian woman Mileva Marić in January 1903.
                                    In 1917, Einstein became very sick with an illness that almost
            killed him, fortunately he survived. His cousin Elsa Löwenthal nursed him back to health. 
            After this happened, Einstein divorced Mileva in 14 February 1919, and married Elsa on 
            2 June 1919.

            Albert's Childhood Life
        </h2>
        <p>
            Einstein's first daughter was Lieserl Einstein. She was born in Novi Sad, Vojvodina, 
            Austria-Hungary on January 27, 1902. She spent her first years in the care of Serbian 
            grandparents because her father Albert did not want her to be brought to Switzerland, 
            where he had a job offer at the patent office. Some historians believe she died from 
            scarlet fever.
                        Einstein's two sons were Hans Albert Einstein and Eduard Tete Einstein. Hans 
            Albert was born in Bern, Switzerland in May 1904. He became a professor in Berkeley (California).
            Eduard was born in Zürich, Switzerland in July 1910. He died at 55 years old of a stroke in the 
            Psychiatric University Hospital Zurich "Burgholzli" . He had spent his life in and out of 
            hospitals due to his schizophrenia.

        <h2>
            His Life as a young Man
        </h2>
        <p>
            In spring of 1914, he moved back to Germany, and became ordinary member of the Prussian Academy 
            and director of a newly established institute for physics of the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gesellschaft. 
            He lived in Berlin and finished the General Theory of Relativity in November 1915. In the Weimar 
            Republic, he was politically active for socialism and Zionism. In 1922, he received the Nobel 
            prize for Physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect in 1905. He then tried to 
            formulate a general field theory uniting gravitation and electromagnetism, without success. 
            He had reservations about the quantum mechanics invented by Heisenberg (1925) and Schrodinger (1926). 
            In spring of 1933, Einstein and Elsa were traveling in the USA when the Nazi party came to power. 
            The Nazis were violently antisemitic. They called Einstein's relativity theory "Jewish physics," 
            and some German physicists started polemics against his theories. Others, like Planck and Heisenberg, 
            defended Einstein.
                                        After their return to Belgium, considering the threats from the Nazis, 
            Einstein resigned from his position in the Prussian Academy in a letter from Oostende. Einstein and 
            Elsa decided not to go back to Berlin and moved to Princeton, New Jersey in the United States, and 
            in 1940 he became a United States citizen.
                            Before World War II, in August 1939, Einstein at the suggestion of Leó Szilárd 
            wrote to the U.S. president, Franklin D. Roosevelt, to say that the United States should invent an 
            atomic bomb so that the Nazi government could not beat them to the punch. He signed the letter. 
            However, he was not part of the Manhattan Project, which was the project that created the atomic 
            bomb.
                                    Einstein, a Jew but not an Israeli citizen, was offered the presidency in 
            1952 but turned it down, stating "I am deeply moved by the offer from our State of Israel, and at 
            once saddened and ashamed that I cannot accept it. Ehud Olmert was reported to be considering 
            offering the presidency to another non-Israeli, Elie Wiesel, but he was said to be "very not 
            interested".
                            He did his research on gravitation at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, 
            New Jersey until his death on 18 April 1955 of a burst aortic aneurysm. He was still writing about 
            quantum physics hours before he died. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics.

           Theory of relativity
       </h2>
       <p>
            The theory of special relativity was published by Einstein in 1905, in the paper On the Electrodynamics 
            of Moving Bodies. It says that both distance measurements and time measurements change near the speed of 
            light. This means that as one get closer to the speed of light (nearly 300,000 kilometres per second), 
            lengths appear to get shorter, and clocks tick more slowly. Einstein said that special relativity is 
            based on two ideas. The first is that the laws of physics are the same for all observers that are not moving
            in relation to each other.
                            Things going in the same direction at the same speed are said to be in an "inertial frame". 
            People in the same "frame" measure how long something takes to happen. Their clocks keep the same time. But in 
            another "frame" their clocks move at a different rate. The reason this happens is as follows. No matter how 
            an observer is moving, if he measures the speed of the light coming from that star it will always be the same 
            number.
                        Imagine an astronaut were all alone in a different universe. It just has an astronaut and a spaceship. 
            Is he moving? Is he standing still? Those questions do not mean anything. Why? Because when we say we are moving we 
            mean that we can measure our distance from something else at various times. If the numbers get bigger we are moving 
            away. If the numbers get smaller we are moving closer. To have movement you must have at least two things. An 
            airplane can be moving at several hundred kilometers per hour, but passengers say, "I am just sitting here." 
                                Suppose some people are on a spaceship and they want to make an accurate clock. At one end they 
            put a mirror, and at the other end they put a simple machine. It shoots one short burst of light toward the mirror 
            and then waits. The light hits the mirror and bounces back. When it hits a light detector on the machine, the machine 
            says, "Count = 1," it simultaneously shoots another short burst of light toward the mirror, and when that light comes 
            back the machine says, "Count = 2." They decide that a certain number of bounces will be defined as a second, and 
            they make the machine change the seconds counter every time it has detected that number of bounces. Every time it changes 
            the seconds counter it also flashes a light out through a porthole under the machine. So somebody outside can see the 
            light flashing every second. 
                    Every grade school child learns the formula d=rt (distance equals rate multiplied by time). We know the speed of 
            light, and we can easily measure the distance between the machine and the mirror and multiple that to give the distance the 
            light travels. So we have both d and r, and we can easily calculate t. The people on the spaceship compare their new "light 
            clock" with their various wrist watches and other clocks, and they are satisfied that they can measure time well using their 
            new light clock.
                            Now this spaceship happens to be going very fast. They see a flash from the clock on the space ship, and 
            then they see another flash. Only the flashes do not come a second apart. They come at a slower rate. Light always goes at 
            the same speed, d = rt. That is why the clock on the spaceship is not flashing once a second for the outside observer.
                    Special relativity also relates energy with mass, in Albert Einstein's E=mc2 formula.

            Mass-Energy Equivalence
        </h2>
        <p>
                E=mc2, also called the mass-energy equivalence, is one of the things that Einstein is most famous for. It is a 
            famous equation in physics and math that shows what happens when mass changes to energy or energy changes to mass. 
            The "E" in the equation stands for energy. Energy is a number which you give to objects depending on how much they 
            can change other things. For instance, a brick hanging over an egg can put enough energy onto the egg to break it. 
            A feather hanging over an egg does not have enough energy to hurt the egg.
                        There are three basic forms of energy: potential energy, kinetic energy, and rest energy. Two of these 
            forms of energy can be seen in the examples given above, and in the example of a pendulum.

                Momentum Mass And Energy
            </h2>
            <p>
                In classical physics, momentum is explained by the equation:  p = mv
                where p represents momentum, m represents mass and v represents velocity (speed)
                When Einstein generalized classical physics to include the increase of mass due to the 
                velocity of the moving matter, he arrived at an equation that predicted energy to be 
                made of two components. One component involves "rest mass" and the other component involves 
                momentum, but momentum is not defined in the classical way. The equation typically has 
                values greater than zero for both components:E2 = (m0c2)2 + (pc)2
                where E represents the energy of a particle, m0 represents the mass of the particle when it 
                is not moving, p represents the momentum of the particle when it is moving, c represents the 
                speed of light.
                There are two special cases of this equation. A photon has no rest mass, but it has momentum.
                (Light reflecting from a mirror pushes the mirror with a force that can be measured.) In the 
                case of a photon, because its m0 = 0, then:  E2 = 0 + (pc)2, E = pc, p = E/c
                           The energy of a photon can be computed from its frequency ν or wavelength λ. 
                These are related to each other by Planck's relation, E = hν = hc/λ, where h is the Planck 
                constant (6.626×10−34 joule-seconds). Knowing either frequency or wavelength, you can compute 
                the photon's momentum. In the case of motionless particles with mass, since p = 0, then:
                E02 = (m0c2)2 + 0, which is just E0 = m0c2, Therefore, the quantity "m0" used in Einstein's 
                equation is sometimes called the "rest mass." (The "0" reminds us that we are talking about 
                the energy and mass when the speed is 0.) This famous "mass-energy relation" formula (usually 
                written without the "0"s) suggests that mass has a large amount of energy, so maybe we could 
                convert some mass to a more useful form of energy. The nuclear power industry is based on that 
                idea.
                                    Einstein said that it was not a good idea to use the classical formula 
                relating momentum to velocity, p = mv, but that if someone wanted to do that, he would have to 
                use a particle mass m that changes with speed: mv2 = m02 / (1 – v2/c2) In this case, we can say 
                that E = mc2 is also true for moving particles.

                The General Theory of relativity
            </h2>
            <p>
                The General Theory of Relativity was published in 1915, ten years after the special theory of 
                relativity was created. Einstein's general theory of relativity uses the idea of spacetime. 
                Spacetime is the fact that we have a four-dimensional universe, having three spatial (space) 
                dimensions and one temporal (time) dimension. Any physical event happens at some place inside 
                these three space dimensions, and at some moment in time. According to the general theory of 
                relativity, any mass causes spacetime to curve, and any other mass follows these curves. 
                Bigger mass causes more curving. This was a new way to explain gravitation (gravity).
                            General relativity explains gravitational lensing, which is light bending when it 
                comes near a massive object. This explanation was proven correct during a solar eclipse, when 
                the sun's bending of starlight from distant stars could be measured because of the darkness of 
                the eclipse.
                                    General relativity also set the stage for cosmology (theories of the 
                structure of our universe at large distances and over long times). Einstein thought that the 
                universe may curve a little bit in both space and time, so that the universe always had existed 
                and always will exist, and so that if an object moved through the universe without bumping into 
                anything, it would return to its starting place, from the other direction, after a very long time. 
                He even changed his equations to include a "cosmological constant," in order to allow a mathematical 
                model of an unchanging universe. The general theory of relativity also allows the universe to 
                spread out (grow larger and less dense) forever, and most scientists think that astronomy has proved 
                that this is what happens. When Einstein realized that good models of the universe were possible 
                even without the cosmological constant, he called his use of the cosmological constant his "biggest 
                blunder," and that constant is often left out of the theory. However, many scientists now believe 
                that the cosmological constant is needed to fit in all that we now know about the universe.
                                A popular theory of cosmology is called the Big Bang. According to the Big Bang 
                theory, the universe was formed 15 billion years ago, in what is called a "gravitational singularity". 
                This singularity was small, dense, and very hot. According to this theory, all of the matter that we 
                know today came out of this point.
                        Einstein himself did not have the idea of a "black hole", but later scientists used this name 
                for an object in the universe that bends spacetime so much that not even light can escape it. They 
                think that these ultra-dense objects are formed when giant stars, at least three times the size of 
                our sun, die. This event can follow what is called a supernova. The formation of black holes may be 
                a major source of gravitational waves, so the search for proof of gravitational waves has become an 
                important scientific pursuit.

                Many scientists only care about their work, but Einstein also spoke and wrote often about politics and 
                world peace. He liked the ideas of socialism and of having only one government for the whole world. He 
                also worked for Zionism, the effort to try to create the new country of Israel.
                                Prompted by his colleague L. E. J. Brouwer, Einstein read the philosopher Eric Gutkind's 
                book Choose Life,[18] a discussion of the relationship between Jewish revelation and the modern world. 
                On January 3, 1954, Einstein sent the following reply to Gutkind: "The word God is for me nothing more 
                than the expression and product of human weaknesses, the Bible a collection of honourable, but still 
                primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish. .... For me the Jewish religion like all 
                other religions is an incarnation of the most childish superstitions. In 2018 his letter to Gutkind was 
                sold for $2.9 million.
                            Even though Einstein thought of many ideas that helped scientists understand the world much 
                better, he disagreed with some scientific theories that other scientists liked. The theory of quantum 
                mechanics discusses things that can happen only with certain probabilities, which cannot be predicted 
                with more precision no matter how much information we might have. This theoretical pursuit is different 
                from statistical mechanics, in which Einstein did important work. Einstein did not like the part of 
                quantum theory that denied anything more than the probability that something would be found to be true 
                of something when it was actually measured; he thought that it should be possible to predict anything, 
                if we had the correct theory and enough information. He once said, "I do not believe that God plays 
                dice with the Universe."
                                                Because Einstein helped science so much, his name is now used for several 
                different things. A unit used in photochemistry was named for him. It is equal to Avogadro's number 
                multiplied by the energy of one photon of light. The chemical element Einsteinium is named after the 
                scientist as well.[23] In slang, we sometimes call a very smart person an "Einstein."

            <p>
                Most scientists think that Einstein's theories of special and general relativity work very well, and they 
                use those ideas and formulas in their own work. Einstein disagreed that phenomena in quantum mechanics can 
                happen out of pure chance. He believed that all natural phenomena have explanations that do not include pure
                chance. He spent much of his later life trying to find a "unified field theory" that would include his general 
                relativity theory, Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism, and perhaps a better quantum theory. Most scientists 
                do not think that he succeeded in that attempt.
