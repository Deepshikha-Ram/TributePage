            <p>
                GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. 
                It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.
                This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like repositories, 
                branches, commits, and pull requests. You'll create your own Hello World 
            repository and learn GitHub's pull request workflow, a popular way to create 
            and review code.
            
            In this quickstart guide, you will:
            <ul>
                <li> Create and use a repository<a href="#o3"> (learn more....)</a></li>
                <li> Start and manage a new branch<a href="#04"> (learn more....)</a></li>
                <li> Make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits<a href="#05"> (learn more....)</a></li>
                <li> Open and merge a pull request<a href="#06"> (learn more....)</a></li>
            </ul>
            To complete this tutorial, you need a GitHub account and 
            Internet access. You don't need to know how to code, use the command 
            line, or install Git (the version control software that GitHub is built 
            on). If you have a question about any of the expressions used in this 
            guide, head on over to the glossary to find out more about our terminology.

                Creating a repository
            </h2>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                A repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories 
                can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets 
                -- anything your project needs. Often, repositories include a README file, 
                a file with information about your project. README files are written in 
                the plain text Markdown language. You can use this 
                <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/"> cheat sheet </a> to 
                get started with Markdown syntax. GitHub lets you add a README file at the 
                same time you create your new repository. GitHub also offers other common 
                options such as a license file, but you do not have to select any of them 
                now.<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world">read more...</a>.

                Creating A branch 
            </h2>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                Branching lets you have different versions of a repository at one time.
                By default, your repository has one branch named main that 
                is considered to be the definitive branch. You can create additional 
                branches off of main in your repository. You can use branches to have 
                different versions of a project at one time. This is helpful when you 
                want to add new features to a project without changing the main source 
                of code. The work done on different branches will not show up on the main 
                branch until you merge it, which we will cover later in this guide. You 
                can use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to 
                main.<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world">read more...</a>

                Opening pull request.
            </h2>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                Now that you have changes in a branch off of main, you can open a pull request.
                Pull requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open 
                a pull request, you're proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and 
                pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show diffs, 
                or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and 
                subtractions are shown in different colors.
                As soon as you make a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion, 
                even before the code is finished.
                By using GitHub's @mention feature in your pull request message, you can 
                ask for feedback from specific people or teams, whether they're down the hall or 10 time 
                zones away.<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world">read more...</a>

                Merging your pull request
            </h2>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                In this final step, you will merge your readme-edits branch into the main branch. After you 
                merge your pull request, the changes on your readme-edits branch will be incorporated into 
                main.
                            Sometimes, a pull request may introduce changes to code that conflict with the 
                existing code on main. If there are any conflicts, GitHub will alert you about the conflicting 
                code and prevent merging until the conflicts are resolved. You can make a commit that resolves 
                the conflicts or use comments in the pull request to discuss the conflicts with your team members.
